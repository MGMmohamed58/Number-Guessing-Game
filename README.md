# Number Guessing Game (Python)

A console-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.

## Features
- Random number generation
- Limited attempts
- Feedback for each guess (too high / too low)

## What I practiced
- While loops
- Conditionals
- Game logic and state

This project helped me understand how simple games are structured (Day 12 ) .
